                    <p>
                    “Meggie?” Ethan hovered in the doorway, clutching his rabbit under his chin. His blue eyes regarded me somberly. “Can I go with you today?”
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                    “What?” Shrugging into my jacket, I gazed around for my backpack. “No, Ethan. I’m going to school now. Big-kids school, no rug rats allowed.”
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                    Luke stood, gently placing Ethan back in his seat. “All right, big guy,” he said, kissing the top of Ethan’s head. “Dad has to fix the bathroom sink, so you sit there and be good. When I’m done, we’ll go feed the pigs, okay?”
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                    With a sigh, I bent down and picked him up.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                    “What’s up, squirt?” I asked, brushing his hair out of his eyes. Mom would need to cut it soon; it was starting to look like a bird’s nest. “You’re awfully clingy this morning. What’s going on?”
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                    “Scared,” Ethan muttered, burying his face in my neck.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                    “You’re scared?”
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                    He shook his head. “Floppy’s scared.”
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                    “What’s Floppy scared of?”
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                    “The man in the closet.”
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                    I felt a small chill slide up my back. Sometimes, Ethan was so quiet and serious, it was hard to remember he was only four. He still had childish fears of monsters under his bed and bogeymen in his closet. In Ethan’s world, stuffed animals spoke to him, invisible men waved to him from the bushes, and scary creatures tapped long nails against his bedroom window. He rarely went to Mom or Luke with stories of monsters and bogeymen; from the time he was old enough to walk, he always came to me.

                        I sighed, knowing he wanted me to go upstairs and check, to reassure him that nothing lurked in his closet or under his bed. I kept a flashlight on his dresser for that very reason.
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <p>
                        Outside, lightning flickered, and thunder rumbled in the distance. I winced. My walk to the bus was not going to be pleasant.

                        <p>
                        Dammit, I don’t have time for this.
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <p>
                        Ethan pulled back and looked at me, eyes pleading. I sighed again. “Fine,” I muttered, putting him down. “Let’s go check for monsters.”
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <p>
                        He followed me silently up the stairs, watching anxiously as I grabbed the flashlight and got down on my knees, shining it under the bed. “No monsters there,” I announced, standing up. I walked to the closet door and flung it open as Ethan peeked out from behind my legs. “No monsters here, either. Think you’ll be all right now?”
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <p>
                        He nodded and gave me a faint smile. I started to close the door when I noticed a strange gray hat in the corner. It was domed on top, with a circular rim and a red band around the base: a bowler hat.
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <p>
                        Weird. Why would that be there?
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <p>
                        As I straightened and started to turn around, something moved out of the corner of my eye. I caught a glimpse of a figure hiding behind Ethan’s bedroom door, its pale eyes watching me through the crack. I jerked my head around, but of course there was nothing there.
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <p>
                        Jeez, now Ethan’s got me seeing imaginary monsters. I need to stop watching those late-night horror flicks.
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <p>
                        A thunderous boom directly overhead made me jump, and fat drops plinked against the windowpanes. Rushing past Ethan, I burst out of the house and sprinted down the driveway...
