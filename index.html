                    <hr>
                    <p>A long time ago there, were many Kingdoms. The two most well known ones were the 
                    Kingdom of Shadows and the Kingdom of Light. 
                    These kingdoms were great rivals. They both fought and raided each other constantly. Eventually, these two kingdoms declared war on each other, amassing armies, and making alliances. Most Kingdoms were made to pick a side. Kingdoms that didn't choose a side were destroyed.
                    The war lasted twenty long years. When it finally ended, all of the kingdoms were left in ruin.
                    Few survived the war, and even fewer survived once the kingdoms were destroyed. 
                    </p>
                    <p>One of the people, <span class="bold">Shadow</span>, was from The Kingdom of Ancients, the oldest kingdom before the war. Shadow was different from others in her kingdom though. She had ancient powers not seen since the beginning of their civilization. Shadow could see the future.
                    Before the war started, Shadow made two prophecies. One of the kingdoms’ raze, and another of their return.

                        One blown away in the tide of war<br>

                        An honorable Kingdom ends without valor or honor<br>

                        A Kingdom destroyed because of truth and lies<br>

                    <p>When Shadow finished both prophecies, she vanished to a place no one knew where. Many years passed and Shadow became nothing more than a legend and a myth. The few who remembered her existence only remembered her as the Prophet.
                    In the years of war, however, Shadow wasn’t the only thing to disappear. Heirlooms from the leaders of the kingdoms began to disappear. When an heirloom from a certain kingdom is found, it is said that the heir to the kingdom is the only one able to bring forth a legendary creature representing that specific kingdom.
                    Many years after the war, people left the ruins of their kingdoms to survive, although, very few were able to. Even people from the kingdom of Time started to fade once the kingdom was destroyed. 
                    It was over 20,000 years before something spectacular happened.
